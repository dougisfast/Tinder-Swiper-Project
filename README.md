# Tinder-Swiper-Project
An automated tinder swiper using Selenium and Webdriver

Author: Douglas Snow
Date: January 2023
Objective: Learn about python, webdriver, and selenium and hopefully meet some women (complete, not complete)

About tinder.py:
 - Tinder.py starts by launching tinder on a chrome browser, then it attempts to log the user in using my phone number 

Update:
Unfortunatly Tinder has banned me because evidently they don't like robots (this seems discriminatory if you ask me)
SO, this project will likely never meet its completion but I do hope to create a facial recognition program sometime when I have a couple days off!
